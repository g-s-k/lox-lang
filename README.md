# lox-lang: a Lox runtime for Rust projects

Lox is a (mostly) toy scripting language designed by Bob Nystrom for his book
[Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com). This library (and the
included wrapper binary) implement a virtual machine runtime for it that can be
used on its own or embedded into a larger application. See the crate
documentation for usage information.
